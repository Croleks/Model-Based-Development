The new proyect has been uploaded, this example it's a simple multithreading mergesort using the "composite" desing pattern;
in order to make it easier to understand we haven't implemented a sorting algorithm, we used the built-in "Collections.sort()" function;
Note: this example ONLY shows an example of how to implement the COMPOSITE desing pattern, it doesn't include any kind of reference to ITERATOR.
